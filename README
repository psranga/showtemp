Dead simple temperature monitor for Intel Core 2 CPUs
running Ubuntu.

Probably wont work correctly other Linux distribs/AMD CPUs
etc (reads /dev/cpu/0/msr file directly).

I wanted a simple console utility to test if I had
installed my heat sink correctly without bothering with
installing too many other apps and libraries.

Compiling
=========

gcc -o showtemp showtemp.c

How cool is that?!
